# -Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It's a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking 'X' or 'O' in an empty square. The goal is to get three of your marks in a row, column, or diagonal before your opponent.
